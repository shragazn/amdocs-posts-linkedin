I also got to see a fascinating futuristic car exhibition - #IAA2023.Even during the festival, I encountered in one of the #Amazing things Amdocs is doing: supporting Vodafone's cell-tower which allows full service in crowded areas. It was really cool, because myself also supporting Vodafone's team at Amdocs.The following week has begun with some amazing opportunities for volunteering activities with the great the Finance unit, as part of Amdocs' #CSR.Later on, I had the privilege to join the kick of, and be part of the brand new #AmbassadorsClub, led by the great Ayana Gisser!The session was full of great and interesting workshops and lectures, that eventually supposed to improve our ability to market/express ourselves.Lastly (for now), It was absolutely great to have a toast with great colleagues I support and work with on daily basis, towards the new #JewishYear #RoshHaShana.

Best thing you can do for us is to advocate for Israel. Once we’ll hit Gaza with all our might to free the dozens, maybe even hundreds, of hostages, including babies and old women, there will be some unpleasant sights. When people will start talking about our soon to be “disproportional response”, make sure to remind them that they opened a war by massacring hundreds of civilians including babies in their houses in Israel, and kidnapped dozens. As always personal stories are better than numbers, so here’s one out of hundreds: A family was burned to death in their house. Sorry for being graphic, it is what it is.

Indiscriminate firing of rockets accompanied the terrorist forces that entered our towns and villages. The reported death toll from this attack has now passed 300 (הי\"ד), and many hundreds of wounded. Also civilians have been kidnapped to Gaza.This is a frightful situation for Israeli citizens here and around the world, and it's encouraging to see global political leadership condemn this move.Many people have described this as senseless violence. But the word \"senseless\" is completely inappropriate here. The evil Hamas leadership (along with their allies) know exactly what they are doing, their publicly stated aims are to kill Jews and destroy the Israel state.My thoughts and prayers are with the security forces who are risking their lives to resolve the situation and to make sure that this horrific assault will not be repeated.

We remind ourselves of the Exodus, and that we are still on a journey. On the last day (Simhat Tora, next Saturday), we come back into our homes and celebrate the intellectual and spiritual elements of Jewish Law, as we complete the yearly cycle of readings from the Chumash (Pentateuch).I'll be somewhat less active on LinkedIn over the holiday period, so no doubt my SSI score will go down, probably no posts. Watch out for the following Sunday when I plan to be back with a bang, some good things to celebrate (e.g. an Amdocs award from Light Reading in the category Wireless Technology Vendor of the Year).In the meantime wishing Chag Sameach (happy holidays) to anyone who is celebrating Sukkot.

Well done team, more to follow from me next week!#DTW23 that's a wrap. My first ever #DTW, and it was (well) Amazing, so thanks Amdocs for sending me to Copenhagen. Difficult to summarize 2.5 intensive days in a short post, but let me try anyway.* The Amdocs booth - looked impressive, unsurprisingly. Actually I tried to keep out of the way as far as possible, to let the professionals get on with the sales and marketing, demos, deal pitches, and whatever other magic Vardit Kuznik Bitan and her marketing aficionados do. But it was good to drop by from time to time and see colleagues from around the world in person, and note that they were doing good business with meetings.* The TMF Innovation Booth and my speaking slot - yes, I gave a short speech on the importance of API standardization, but there was a lot more going on there. Open Digital Architecture (#oda), #OpenAPIs, and other goodies and best practices for the telco industry, including a stand dedicated to ESG* The competition - I spent a lot of Day 2 going round the various booths of vendors, finding out (openly) what's going on. Some people were very happy to talk with me, others were (understandably) more reticent. A common theme from my discussions with our competitors is that (surprise surprise) Generative Artificial Intelligence (#GenAI) is key to success. Whether it's intent-based creation of charging and rating plans in the catalog, or figuring out how to retain your customers by anticipating what issues they might be having, AI is here to stay. My impression is that as distinct to the over-hyping of the metaverse (including at last year's DTW), Gen AI really is poised to make an impact in the communications and digital service industry (and of course in other verticals).* APIs Everywhere - many speaker sessions this DTW were devoted to telcos and vendors explaining how they have used the TMF Open APIs to advance and streamline their business. Vendors proudly displaying their various Open API certification achievements on their booths. And of course TMF published 22 new Gen5 APIs. As a major contributor to the Open API program, this is great news. We're always on the lookout for improvement suggestions, and I was doing an unofficial survey to find out if people had needed to extend APIs or use them as-is. It was about 50:50. I'd be happy to get feedback on how to enhance the API designs.I'll leave you with some commemorative pictures - and we'll see if I get invited to the 2024 event, which has moved to June.#myamdocsvoice #makeitamazing #amdocs #tmf #tmforum #ignite --------------------------------I'm Jonathan Goldberg, part-time #LinkedIn addict, and doing side work as an integration architect 😁 .Follow me for life at Amdocs, TM Forum, and more.

The standard ensures that it will be clear how to invoke the get, and what the fields/properties of the customer are.TMF announced yesterday the release of 22 API definitions, the first tranche of the Generation 5 series of Open APIs. Amdocs is proud to have contributed 7 of these APIs (I personally worked on 4 of those). Of course the Open API project, like all standards initiatives, is a cooperative effort. It's been a pleasure to work with colleagues from service providers, other vendors (competitors 😊), and TM Forum focals, to reach this milestone.Take a look here at the Open API production table, and note the APIs that were published in September 2023.https://lnkd.in/dm7P7JiB#myamdocsvoice #makeitamazing #amdocs #tmf #tmforum #ignite #dtw23 #dtw #openapis #standardization --------------------------------I'm Jonathan Goldberg, part-time #LinkedIn addict, and doing side work as an integration architect 😁 .Follow me for life at Amdocs, TM Forum, and more.
